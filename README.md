# 🛒 Smart Cart – Intelligent IoT-Enabled Shopping Solution

The **Smart Cart** project aims to enhance the traditional shopping experience by leveraging **IoT**, **BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)**, and a responsive **user interface**. With real-time cart monitoring, smart billing, and wireless communication, this project reduces checkout time and improves customer convenience.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 **Automatic Product Detection** via Computer vision
- 📟 **Real-time Cart Interface** displaying products, prices, and total bill
- 📲 **BLE Communication** for seamless data exchange between cart and mobile app/server
- ⚖️ **Load Cell Support** for weight validation and theft prevention
- ☁️ **IoT Integration** with cloud/database for live monitoring (optional)
- 💳 **Smart Checkout** via contactless payment methods

## 🧱 Project Structure


## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **C/C++** – Embedded systems (Raspberry Pi/ESP32)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** – Interface (can be modified for mobile/web)
- **BLE (e.g., HC-05, ESP32)** – Wireless communication
- **RFID, Load Cell, OLED/LCD** – Sensor and display modules
- *(Optional)* **Firebase/MQTT** – Cloud data sync and analytics

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 or Rpi microcontroller  
- BLE module (e.g., HC-05/ESP32 built-in BLE)  
- RFID scanner (e.g., MFRC522)  
- Load cell + HX711 module  
- OLED/LCD display  
- Power supply (battery or adapter)

### Software Requirements

- PlatformIo
- VS Code or any code editor (for interface)  
- Drivers for your board (if using ESP32/Arduino)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-cart.git
cd smart-cart
